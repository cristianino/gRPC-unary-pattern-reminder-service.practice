# gRPC Unary Pattern Practice in Go

This repository contains a basic implementation of the gRPC unary pattern in Go, focusing on task management functionalities such as creating tasks with priority and tags, retrieving tasks, and formatting task details.

## Features

- **Create Tasks:** Users can create tasks by specifying a message, limit date, team name, priority, and optional tags.

- **Retrieve Tasks:** Users can retrieve tasks, and the details are formatted for easy readability.

- **Incremental Task IDs:** Tasks are assigned incremental IDs on the server side.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go (1.16 or higher)
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cristianino/gRPC-unary-pattern-reminder-service.practice.git
   cd grpc-unary-pattern-practice
   ```

2. Generate Go code from the `.proto` file:

   ```bash
   protoc --go_out=. --go_opt=paths=source_relative --go-grpc_out=. --go-grpc_opt=paths=source_relative protoService/service.proto
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   go run server/main.go
   ```

4. Run the client:

   ```bash
   go run client/main.go
   ```

### Usage

1. When prompted, choose the option to create a task and provide the required information.

2. Optionally, provide tags when creating a task.

3. Choose the option to retrieve tasks and view the formatted details.
